 ## Introduction
The goal of my CLIM 680 project is to investigate the relationship between the 500hPa geopotential height, 2 meter surface temperature and cold air outbreaks in North America.
I choose this topic because I've have been reading scientific literature on the subject and have wanted to investigate.....
I also explored the relationship between 500hPa and with the a climate index, Pacific North American (PNA) pattern. .

## Data
I used 2 datasets: 
- ERA Interim Reanalysis - 500hPa
- ERA
I also used the monthly PNA climate index from NOAA
